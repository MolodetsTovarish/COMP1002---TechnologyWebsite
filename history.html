                <h1>History of the Wheel</h1>
                <p>The wheel is one of the most important pieces of technology in all of human civilization. It has helped us make advances in transportation, industry and agriculture (farm equipment, increased food output). With the invention of the wheel, humans began to use wagons to transport heavy loads over longer distances, use advanced farming equipment to increase the output of food, and started to rely more on machines to help ease (and eventually automate) labor.</p>

                 <p>Before the wheel, people would use sledges or an array of logs to roll heavy laods. The first wheels were made in Mesopotamia in 3500 BCE, believed to be used for crafting pottery. Eventually, the fixed axle was invented to attach the wheel to the cart, which kept the axle in place while the wheels turned. The improved wheel and axle apparatus led the way to modern uses of the wheel.</p>
